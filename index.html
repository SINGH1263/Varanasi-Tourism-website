            <p class="text">Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain, the English author and literature, who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote :
                “Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together”.

                The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth. Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is believed to have the power to wash away the sins of mortals. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth.

                    Varanasi is Said to be the point at which the first jyotirlinga, the fiery pillar of light by which shiva manifested has supremacy over others gods, broke through the Earth’s crust and flared towards the heavens. More than the Gaths and even the Ganga, the Shivalinga installed in the temple remains the devotional focus of Varanasi. Near the Kashi Vishwanath temple, there is a nice temple of Devi Annapurna , believed as the “Godess of Fooding”.

                    Street food is an essential part of the Indian culture and cuisine. There are a number of street foods from across the country that are famous, but nothing can beat the hot and crispy kachoris and samosas from Benaras or Varanasi. The holy city is situated on the banks of the river Ganges in the state of Uttar Pradesh and its food is defined by its culture and tradition. According to Chef Ashwani Kumar Singh from the Leela Ambience Convention Hotel in Delhi, "The food of Benaras or Varanasi is influenced by its people. You will find Marwari traders and people from nearby states including Bihar and West Bengal in the city have added their own regional touch to the local cuisine. The vegetarian delicacies are majorly prepared in desi ghee and mustard oil, be it spicy, sweet or sour. Most Varanasi sweets have a milk and ghee base like the Magdal, Sankat Mochan ke Laddoo, Parval Mithai, Kheer Mohan and Launglata among others."

                    Varanasi, a city in Uttar Pradesh, India, has almost 100 ghats along the holy Ganges River. The main group contains around 25 ghats, extending from Assi Ghat north to Raj Ghat. The ghats date back to the 14th century but most were rebuilt in the 18th century by Maratha rulers. They are either privately owned or have special significance in Hindu mythology and are primarily used for bathing and Hindu religious rituals. However, there are two ghats (Manikarnika and Harishchandra) where cremations are solely performed. The ghats symbolically represent the five diverse elements or Pancha Tattva that constitute the human body. They are believed to be the doorsteps of heaven, and millions of Sadhus and pilgrims pay their tributes to the gods standing on these ghats which play an astounding role in the city's religious activities. Varanasi is a major regional transportation hub, an important railway junction, and is connected by highways to other cities in Uttar Pradesh and surrounding states.
